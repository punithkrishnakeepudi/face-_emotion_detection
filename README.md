# Face Emotion Detection

A project for detecting facial emotions using deep learning models. Built with **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **TensorFlow/Keras** or similar frameworks.

---

## Features

- Real-time facial emotion detection from webcam or images.
- Supports multiple emotion classes (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral).
- Easy-to-use interface for live video feed.
- Pre-trained model integration for quick deployment.
- Customizable for different datasets and models.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

Required libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

*Note: Adjust dependencies based on your specific implementation.*

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/punithkrishnakeepudi/face-_emotion_detection.git
cd face-_emotion_detection
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download or place your pre-trained model in the `models/` folder (e.g., `emotion_model.h5`).

---

## Usage

Run the main detection script:

```bash
python final.py
```

- Open your webcam feed with real-time emotion detection.
- Press `q` or `Esc` to quit.
- For image inference: `python final.py --image path/to/image.jpg`

---

## Model Training

If you want to train your own model:

1. Prepare your dataset in the `data/` folder (FER-2013 or custom).
2. Run the training script:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

3. Monitor training progress with TensorBoard or saved logs.

*Add your actual demo GIF or image here to showcase emotion detection in action.*

---

## Notes

- Ensure good lighting for accurate detection.
- Model accuracy depends on the training dataset.
- For production, consider optimizing for speed with TensorRT or ONNX.
- Webcam access required for live demos.
